The CPR is determined by incorporating the junction into a superconducting loop coupled to a dc SQUID, allowing measurement of the junction phase difference. Junctions fabricated with a thin (\textasciitilde{} 22 nm) barrier of Cu0.47Ni0.53 sandwiched between Nb electrodes exhibit a re-entrant critical current with temperature, vanishing at T =T\_pi \textasciitilde{} 2-4 K. We find that the critical current is negative for T {$<$} T\_pi, indicating that the junction is a pi-Josephson junction. We find no evidence for second-order Josephson tunneling near T\_pi in the CPR predicted by several theories.},

  abstract = {Gaussian units constitute a metric system of physical units. This system is the most common of the several electromagnetic unit systems based on cgs (centimetre–gram–second) units. It is also called the Gaussian unit system, Gaussian-cgs units, or often just cgs units. The term "cgs units" is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: there are several variants of cgs with conflicting definitions of electromagnetic quantities and units. SI units predominate in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units. Alternative unit systems also exist. Conversions between quantities in Gaussian and SI units are not direct unit conversions, because the quantities themselves are defined differently in each system. This means that the equations expressing physical laws of electromagnetism—such as Maxwell's—will change depending on the system of units employed. As an example, quantities that are dimensionless in one system may have dimension in the other.},

  abstract = {Gate-tunable semiconductor-superconductor nanowires with superconducting leads form exotic Josephson junctions that are a highly desirable platform for two types of qubits: those with topological superconductivity (Majorana qubits) and those based on tunable anharmonicity (gatemon qubits). Controlling their behavior, however, requires understanding their electrostatic environment and electronic structure. Here we study gated InAs nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells. By measuring current-phase relations (CPR) and comparing them with analytical and numerical calculations, we show that we can tune the number of modes, determine the transparency of each mode, and tune into regimes in which electron-electron interactions are apparent, indicating the presence of a quantum dot. To take into account electrostatic and geometrical effects, we perform microscopic self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson numerical simulations, revealing the energy spectrum of Andreev states in the junction as well as their spatial distribution. Our work systematically demonstrates the effect of device geometry, gate voltage and phase bias on mode behavior, providing new insights into ongoing experimental efforts and predictive device design.},

  abstract = {The protection against backscattering provided by topology is a striking property. In two-dimensional insulators, a consequence of this topological protection is the ballistic nature of the one-dimensional helical edge states. One demonstration of ballisticity is the quantized Hall conductance. Here we provide another demonstration of ballistic transport, in the way the edge states carry a supercurrent. The system we have investigated is a micrometre-long monocrystalline bismuth nanowire with topological surfaces, that we connect to two superconducting electrodes. We have measured the relation between the Josephson current flowing through the nanowire and the superconducting phase difference at its ends, the current–phase relation. The sharp sawtooth-shaped phase-modulated current–phase relation we find demonstrates that transport occurs selectively along two ballistic edges of the nanowire. In addition, we show that a magnetic field induces 0–π transitions and ϕ0-junction behaviour, providing a way to manipulate the phase of the supercurrent-carrying edge states and generate spin supercurrents.},

  abstract = {Current imaging is crucial to condensed matter physics, materials research and industry. State-of-the-art current imaging setups revolve around SQUIDon-tip (SOT) probes, that scan over a sample to locally measure magnetic fields and temperature. The resolution of such systems is presently limited by the lack of a robust method to control the probe-sample distance. In this thesis, we develop probes for hybrid microscopy that combine SOT with STM. We theoretically investigate interesting systems, and find that our approach would considerably improve on past magnetic investigations of vortex matter. We use focused-ion-beam milling to fabricate SOT probes on top of a commercial AFM-cantilever, and show these to be very sensitive to changes in applied magnetic field and temperature. We develop a novel readout scheme to simultaneously measure a magnetic and a tunneling signal. We present a proof-of-concept STMSOT probe that displays magnetic sensitivity inside a cryogenic STM setup, and use it as an STM probe to see the topography of a NbSe2 crystal. Our approach will culminate in the development of a STMSOT setup in the near future.},

The exotic current-phase relation is realized in the vicinity of a temperature-controlled 0-to-\$\textbackslash pi\$ junction transition, at which the first Josephson harmonic vanishes. Direct current-phase relation measurements, as well as Josephson interferometry, non-vanishing supercurrent and half-integer Shapiro steps at the 0-\$\textbackslash pi\$ transition self-consistently point to an intrinsic second harmonic term, making it possible to rule out common alternative origins of half-periodic behavior. While surprising for diffusive multimode junctions, the large second harmonic is in agreement with theory predictions for thin ferromagnetic interlayers.},
