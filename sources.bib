  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏω. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏω)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0°K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

  abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the spatial distribution of magnetic fields and Meissner screening currents in two-dimensional (2D) superconductors and mesoscopic thin film superconducting devices is critical to interpreting the results of magnetic measurements of such systems. Here, we introduce SuperScreen, an open-source Python package for simulating the response of 2D superconductors to trapped flux and applied time-independent or quasi-DC magnetic fields for any value of the effective magnetic penetration depth, Λ. Given an applied magnetic field, SuperScreen solves the 2D London equation using an efficient matrix inversion method [1], [2] to obtain the Meissner currents and magnetic fields in and around structures composed of one or more superconducting thin films of arbitrary geometry. SuperScreen can be used to model screening effects and calculate self- and mutual-inductance in thin film superconducting devices.

  abstract = {The Josephson diode (JD) is a non-reciprocal circuit element that supports a larger critical current in one direction compared to the other. This effect has gained a growing interest because of promising applications in superconducting electronic circuits with low power consumption. Some implementations of a JD rely on breaking the inversion symmetry in the material used to realize Josephson junctions (JJs), but a recent theoretical proposal has suggested that the effect can also be engineered by combining two JJs hosting highly transmitting Andreev bound states in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) at a small, but finite flux bias [1]. We realized a SQUID with two JJs fabricated in a proximitized InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We demonstrate gate control of the diode efficiency from zero up to around \$30\$\textbackslash\% for different flux biases which comes close to the maximum of \$\textbackslash sim 40\$\textbackslash\% predicated in Ref. [1]. The key ingredient to the JD effect in the SQUID arrangement is the presence of an asymmetry between the two SQUID arms.},

  abstract = {We have studied Superconductor-Ferromagnet-Superconductor (SFS) Nb-CuNi-Nb Josephson junctions that can transition between the 0 junction and the π junction states with temperature. By direct measurement of the current-phase relation (CPR) we have determined that the critical current of some SFS junctions changes sign as a function of temperature, indicating the π junction behavior. The CPR was de- termined by incorporating the junction into an rf SQUID geometry coupled to a dc SQUID magnetometer, allowing measurement of the junction phase difference. No evidence for the second-order Josephson tunneling, that was predicted by a number of theories to be observable near the 0-π transition temperature, was found in the CPR. In non-uniform 0-π SFS junctions with spatial variations in the effective bar- rier thickness, our data is consistent with spontaneous currents circulating around the 0-π boundaries. These spontaneous currents give rise to Shapiro steps in the current- voltage characteristics at half-integer Josephson voltages when the rf-modulation is added to the bias current. The degree of 0-π junction non-uniformity was deter- mined from measurements of the critical current vs. applied magnetic flux patterns. Scanning SQUID Microscope imaging of superconducting arrays with SFS junctions revealed spontaneous currents circulating in the arrays in the π junction state below the 0-π transition temperature.},

It is also called the Gaussian unit system, Gaussian-cgs units, or often just cgs units. The term "cgs units" is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: there are several variants of cgs with conflicting definitions of electromagnetic quantities and units. SI units predominate in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units. Alternative unit systems also exist. Conversions between quantities in Gaussian and SI units are not direct unit conversions, because the quantities themselves are defined differently in each system. This means that the equations expressing physical laws of electromagnetism—such as Maxwell's—will change depending on the system of units employed. As an example, quantities that are dimensionless in one system may have dimension in the other.},

By measuring current-phase relations (CPR) and comparing them with analytical and numerical calculations, we show that we can tune the number of modes, determine the transparency of each mode, and tune into regimes in which electron-electron interactions are apparent, indicating the presence of a quantum dot. To take into account electrostatic and geometrical effects, we perform microscopic self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson numerical simulations, revealing the energy spectrum of Andreev states in the junction as well as their spatial distribution.

The input coil consists of a multiple-turn secondary in the form of a spiral stripline fabricated directly above the primary.

All have mutual inductances per turn of approximately 80 pH, in good agreement with numerical calculations. Detailed measurements on the 50-turn SQUID gave a mutual inductance M of 3.8 nH, an input coil inductance Liof 190 nH, a SQUID self inductance of L of 89 pH, and a coupling constant k2= M2/LiL of 0.86.

In superconductor–TI–superconductor Josephson junctions, the supercurrent versus the phase difference between the superconductors, referred to as the current–phase relation (CPR), reveals important information including the nature of the superconducting transport. Here, we study the induced superconductivity in gate-tunable Josephson junctions (JJs) made from topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 with superconducting Nb electrodes. We observe highly skewed (non-sinusoidal) CPR in these junctions. The critical current, or the magnitude of the CPR, increases with decreasing temperature down to the lowest accessible temperature (T\,\textasciitilde\,20\,mK), revealing the existence of low-energy modes in our junctions. The gate dependence shows that close to the Dirac point the CPR becomes less skewed, indicating the transport is more diffusive, most likely due to the presence of electron/hole puddles and charge inhomogeneity. Our experiments provide strong evidence that superconductivity is induced in the highly ballistic topological surface states (TSS) in our gate-tunable TI-based JJs. Furthermore, the measured CPR is in good agreement with the prediction of a model which calculates the phase-dependent eigenstate energies in our system, considering the finite width of the electrodes, as well as the TSS wave functions extending over the entire circumference of the TI.},

While exceptionally rare in nature, triplet pairing of electrons can occur if either the temporal or spatial component of the superconducting wavefunction can be represented by an odd function. These are often referred to as odd-frequency and odd-parity triplets, respectively.

  abstract = {This review covers experimental results and theoretical ideas on the properties of superconducting weak links, i.e., weak electrical contacts between superconducting electrodes which exhibit direct (non-tunnel-type) conductivity. When the dimensions of such weak links are sufficiently small, the Josephson effect is observed in them, in other words, a single-valued and 2π -periodic relationship exists between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference σ of the electrodes. With increasing dimensions, this relationship has a tendency to deviate gradually from the Josephson behavior. This deviation varies, depending on whether the weak link material is a superconductor or a normal metal. The various known types of weak links are described, and special mention is made of those weak links which are most suitable for physical investigations and have various practical applications. The data on the nonstationary (ac) processes in weak links, when the phase difference varies with time, are analyzed. In conclusion the existing concepts about the processes in weak links are briefly summarized and the most urgent outstanding problems are outlined.},

The nanoSQUIDs are fabricated by epitaxial growth of 120 nm-thick films of the high-transition temperature cuprate superconductor YBCO               via               pulsed laser deposition on MgO bicrystal substrates with 24° misorientation angle, followed by sputtering of               d               Au               = 65 nm thick Au. Nanopatterning is performed by Ga focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The SQUID performance is comparable to devices on SrTiO               3               (STO), as demonstrated by electric transport and noise measurements at 4.2 K. MgO has orders of magnitude smaller dielectric permittivity than STO;               i.e.               , one may avoid Au as a resistively shunting layer to reduce the intrinsic thermal flux noise of the nanoSQUIDs. However, we find that the Au layer is important for avoiding degradation during FIB milling. Hence, we compare devices with different               d               Au               produced by thinning the Au layer               via               Ar ion milling after FIB patterning. We find that the reduction of               d               Au               yields an increase in junction resistance, however at the expense of a reduction of the critical current and increase in SQUID inductance. This results in an estimated thermal flux noise that is almost independent of               d               Au               . However, for two devices on MgO with 65 nm-thick Au, we find an order of magnitude lower low-frequency excess noise as compared to nanoSQUIDs on STO or those on MgO with reduced               d               Au               . For one of those devices we obtain with bias-reversal readout ultra-low flux noise of ∼175 n               Φ               0               Hz               −1/2               down to ∼10 Hz.},

The variation was more rapid than expected from the BCS theory of superconductivity, in contrast to the situation in previously measured superconductors where it was less rapid. Just as in the previous cases, the results here can be understood in terms of a variation of the energy gap different from that predicted by the BCS theory. A comparison with the energy gap deduced by Dobbs and Perz from their ultrasonic-attenuation measurements is given. The penetration depth at absolute zero, λ(0), is estimated from the present results to be 470±50 Å, while the London penetration depth λL(0) is 390±50 Å.},

In two-dimensional insulators, a consequence of this topological protection is the ballistic nature of the one-dimensional helical edge states. One demonstration of ballisticity is the quantized Hall conductance. Here we provide another demonstration of ballistic transport, in the way the edge states carry a supercurrent. The system we have investigated is a micrometre-long monocrystalline bismuth nanowire with topological surfaces, that we connect to two superconducting electrodes. We have measured the relation between the Josephson current flowing through the nanowire and the superconducting phase difference at its ends, the current–phase relation. The sharp sawtooth-shaped phase-modulated current–phase relation we find demonstrates that transport occurs selectively along two ballistic edges of the nanowire. In addition, we show that a magnetic field induces 0–π transitions and ϕ0-junction behaviour, providing a way to manipulate the phase of the supercurrent-carrying edge states and generate spin supercurrents.},

  abstract = {The non-dissipative nonlinearity of Josephson junctions1 converts macroscopic superconducting circuits into artificial atoms2, enabling some of the best-controlled qubits today3,4. Three fundamental types of superconducting qubit are known5, each reflecting a distinct behaviour of quantum fluctuations in a Cooper pair condensate: single-charge tunnelling (charge qubit6,7), single-flux tunnelling (flux qubit8) and phase oscillations (phase qubit9 or transmon10). Yet, the dual nature of charge and flux suggests that circuit atoms must come in pairs. Here we introduce the missing superconducting qubit, ‘blochnium’, which exploits a coherent insulating response of a single Josephson junction that emerges from the extension of phase fluctuations beyond 2π (refs. 11–14). Evidence for such an effect has been found in out-of-equilibrium direct-current transport through junctions connected to high-impedance leads15–19, although a full consensus on the existence of extended phase fluctuations is so far absent20–22. We shunt a weak junction with an extremely high inductance—the key technological innovation in our experiment—and measure the radiofrequency excitation spectrum as a function of external magnetic flux through the resulting loop. The insulating character of the junction is manifested by the vanishing flux sensitivity of the qubit transition between the ground state and the first excited state, which recovers rapidly for transitions to higher-energy states. The spectrum agrees with a duality mapping of blochnium onto a transmon, which replaces the external flux by the offset charge and introduces a new collective quasicharge variable instead of the superconducting phase23,24. Our findings may motivate the exploration of macroscopic quantum dynamics in ultrahigh-impedance circuits, with potential applications in quantum computing and metrology.},

  abstract = {The superconducting transmon qubit is a leading platform for quantum computing and quantum science. Building large, useful quantum systems based on transmon qubits will require significant improvements in qubit relaxation and coherence times, which are orders of magnitude shorter than limits imposed by bulk properties of the constituent materials. This indicates that relaxation likely originates from uncontrolled surfaces, interfaces, and contaminants. Previous efforts to improve qubit lifetimes have focused primarily on designs that minimize contributions from surfaces. However, significant improvements in the lifetime of two-dimensional transmon qubits have remained elusive for several years. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional transmon qubits that have both lifetimes and coherence times with dynamical decoupling exceeding 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device. We have observed increased lifetimes for seventeen devices, indicating that these material improvements are robust, paving the way for higher gate fidelities in multi-qubit processors.},

The control mechanism is based on hot phonons which are injected into the superconducting microbridges from close proximity, but electrically isolated, normal-metal constrictions. We have also developed a one-dimensional computer model to analyze the behavior of micro-SQUID devices including situations in which we modify the asymmetry of the device. We show from the model that the experimental results are consistent with a change in effective length of the microbridge junctions with respect to the coherence length of the film. The experimental data, and its interpretation in relation to the micro-SQUID model, confirm that this technique, based on hot-phonon irradiation for controlling the critical current in Dayem bridge Josephson junctions, is compatible with the Josephson effect and a feasible method for post-fabrication parameter control in superconducting circuits using Dayem bridge Josephson junctions.},

Here, we use a numerical simulation that includes thermal noise to investigate the sensitivity of a DC superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with such junctions. The simulation uses a resistively and capacitively shunted junction model where the current-phase relation of each junction can be defined as an arbitrary function. The modulation, transfer function, noise, and sensitivity of a SQUID are calculated for different types of current-phase relation. For the examples considered here, we find that the flux sensitivity of the SQUID is always degraded by forward skewing of the current-phase relation, even in cases where the transfer function of the SQUID has been improved.},

State-of-the-art current imaging setups revolve around SQUIDon-tip (SOT) probes, that scan over a sample to locally measure magnetic fields and temperature. The resolution of such systems is presently limited by the lack of a robust method to control the probe-sample distance. In this thesis, we develop probes for hybrid microscopy that combine SOT with STM. We theoretically investigate interesting systems, and find that our approach would considerably improve on past magnetic investigations of vortex matter. We use focused-ion-beam milling to fabricate SOT probes on top of a commercial AFM-cantilever, and show these to be very sensitive to changes in applied magnetic field and temperature. We develop a novel readout scheme to simultaneously measure a magnetic and a tunneling signal. We present a proof-of-concept STMSOT probe that displays magnetic sensitivity inside a cryogenic STM setup, and use it as an STM probe to see the topography of a NbSe2 crystal. Our approach will culminate in the development of a STMSOT setup in the near future.},

  abstract = {The critical temperature in a superconducting ring changes periodically with the magnetic flux threading it, giving rise to the well-known Little-Parks magnetoresistance oscillations. Periodic changes of the critical current in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), consisting of two Josephson junctions in a ring, lead to a different type of magnetoresistance oscillations utilized in detecting extremely small changes in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate current-induced switching between Little-Parks and SQUID magnetoresistance oscillations in a superconducting nano-ring without Josephson junctions. Our measurements in Nb nano-rings show that as the bias current increases, the parabolic Little-Parks magnetoresistance oscillations become sinusoidal and eventually transform into oscillations typical of a SQUID. We associate this phenomenon with the flux-induced non-uniformity of the order parameter along a superconducting nano-ring, arising from the superconducting leads (‘arms’) attached to it. Current enhanced phase slip rates at the points with minimal order parameter create effective Josephson junctions in the ring, switching it into a SQUID.},

Our observation of Shapiro steps in the dissipative branch shows that a finite Josephson coupling exists in the dissipative state. Although the nanobridge is heated, our model shows that the temperature remains below the critical temperature. This work provides evidence that Josephson behavior can still exist in thermally hysteretic weak-link devices and will allow extension of the temperature range over which nanobridge-based single-flux-quantum circuits, micron-sized superconducting quantum interference devices (i.e., nanoSQUIDs), and Josephson voltage standards can be used.},

We show that, due to their complex structure domain walls can carry vortices with fractional flux quanta. The decay of conventional vortices into fractional ones on domain walls is examined. This decay presents an extraordinarily strong pinning mechanism for vortices and turns domain walls occupied with pinned fractional vortices into efficient barriers for the vortex motion. Therefore, domain walls can act as fences for the flux flow, preventing the decay of the remnant magnetic flux enclosed by them. Furthermore, the consequences of this property of domain walls on the vortex dynamics are discussed in connection with observed noise in the hysteresis cycle, using the Bean model of the critical vortex state. Based on this picture experimental data in the unconventional superconductors UPt3, U1-xThxBe13 and Sr2RuO4 are interpreted.},

The exotic current-phase relation is realized in the vicinity of a temperature-controlled 0-to-\$\textbackslash pi\$ junction transition, at which the first Josephson harmonic vanishes. Direct current-phase relation measurements, as well as Josephson interferometry, non-vanishing supercurrent and half-integer Shapiro steps at the 0-\$\textbackslash pi\$ transition self-consistently point to an intrinsic second harmonic term, making it possible to rule out common alternative origins of half-periodic behavior. While surprising for diffusive multimode junctions, the large second harmonic is in agreement with theory predictions for thin ferromagnetic interlayers.},

Similarly, a phase battery is a quantum device that provides a persistent phase bias to the wave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum technologies based on phase coherence. Here we demonstrate a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting circuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface states, that is proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the ferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted into a persistent phase bias φ0 across the wire, leading to the anomalous Josephson effect1,2. We apply an external in-plane magnetic field and, thereby, achieve continuous tuning of φ0. Hence, we can charge and discharge the quantum phase battery. The observed symmetries of the anomalous Josephson effect in the vectorial magnetic field are in agreement with our theoretical model. Our results demonstrate how the combined action of spin–orbit coupling and exchange interaction induces a strong coupling between charge, spin and superconducting phase, able to break the phase rigidity of the system.},

  abstract = {Currently, much effort is being put into detecting unconventional p-wave superconductivity in Josephson junctions based on topological insulators (TIs). For that purpose we propose to use superconducting Klein tunneling, i.e. the reflectionless passage of Cooper pairs through a potential barrier in a gated ballistic junction. This phenomenon occurs due to the fact that the supercurrent is carried by helical Andreev bound states (ABSs) characterized by spin-momentum locking similar to the normal-state carriers. We derive the spectrum of the helical ABSs and the corresponding Josephson current for a junction made on the surface of a three-dimensional TI. The superconducting Klein tunneling is predicted to yield a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation and an anomalous critical current \$I\_c\$ that does not vanish with increasing barrier strength. We also analyze the dependence of the I\_cR\_n product (where R\_n is the normal-state junction resistance) on the microscopic parameters of the superconductor/TI interface, which leads to lower I\_cR\_n values than expected from previous models of the proximity-effect Josephson junctions.},

  abstract = {Magnetic imaging plays an essential part in measuring magnetic sources, whether they are nanoparticles, superconductor vortices, edge currents, or something else. Current techniques either lack the necessary sensitivity and spatial resolution or are too invasive to use in many applications. Scanning SQUIDs are non-invasive and have excellent sensitivity, but operate at a large distance from the surface. By integrating a SQUID into a Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) we will be able to image magnetic sources within 1 nm from the surface, increasing its sensitivity and spatial resolution. It also allows us to simultaneously gather topographic information, something no other scanning SQUID can do. To achieve this, a new production method is developed to create a SQUID on top of a sharp tip. To get a continuous superconducting connection across the surface of the tip, Molybdenum Germanium is used as a superconductor, with silver SNS junctions to prevent hysteresis. Measurements on larger MoGe-Ag SQUIDs show that this design could achieve a theoretical spin sensitivity of 1 μB/ Hz at 4.2 K, with a spatial resolution of 30 nm.},

A consequence of this symmetry is the possible existence of superconducting domains of opposite chirality. At the boundary of such domains, the locally suppressed condensate can produce an intrinsic Josephson junction. Here, we provide evidence of such junctions using mesoscopic rings, structured from Sr2RuO4 single crystals. Our order parameter simulations predict such rings to host stable domain walls across their arms. This is verified with transport experiments on loops, with a sharp transition at 1.5\,K, which show distinct critical current oscillations with periodicity corresponding to the flux quantum. In contrast, loops with broadened transitions at around 3\,K are void of such junctions and show standard Little–Parks oscillations. Our analysis demonstrates the junctions are of intrinsic origin and makes a compelling case for the existence of superconducting domains.},
