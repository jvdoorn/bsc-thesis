  abstract = {We present measurements of the current-phase relation (CPR) of Superconductor-Ferromagnet-Superconductor (SFS) Josephson junctions as a function of temperature. The CPR is determined by incorporating the junction into a superconducting loop coupled to a dc SQUID, allowing measurement of the junction phase difference. Junctions fabricated with a thin (\textasciitilde{} 22 nm) barrier of Cu0.47Ni0.53 sandwiched between Nb electrodes exhibit a re-entrant critical current with temperature, vanishing at T =T\_pi \textasciitilde{} 2-4 K. We find that the critical current is negative for T {$<$} T\_pi, indicating that the junction is a pi-Josephson junction. We find no evidence for second-order Josephson tunneling near T\_pi in the CPR predicted by several theories.},

  abstract = {Gate-tunable semiconductor-superconductor nanowires with superconducting leads form exotic Josephson junctions that are a highly desirable platform for two types of qubits: those with topological superconductivity (Majorana qubits) and those based on tunable anharmonicity (gatemon qubits). Controlling their behavior, however, requires understanding their electrostatic environment and electronic structure. Here we study gated InAs nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells. By measuring current-phase relations (CPR) and comparing them with analytical and numerical calculations, we show that we can tune the number of modes, determine the transparency of each mode, and tune into regimes in which electron-electron interactions are apparent, indicating the presence of a quantum dot. To take into account electrostatic and geometrical effects, we perform microscopic self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson numerical simulations, revealing the energy spectrum of Andreev states in the junction as well as their spatial distribution. Our work systematically demonstrates the effect of device geometry, gate voltage and phase bias on mode behavior, providing new insights into ongoing experimental efforts and predictive device design.},

  abstract = {The protection against backscattering provided by topology is a striking property. In two-dimensional insulators, a consequence of this topological protection is the ballistic nature of the one-dimensional helical edge states. One demonstration of ballisticity is the quantized Hall conductance. Here we provide another demonstration of ballistic transport, in the way the edge states carry a supercurrent. The system we have investigated is a micrometre-long monocrystalline bismuth nanowire with topological surfaces, that we connect to two superconducting electrodes. We have measured the relation between the Josephson current flowing through the nanowire and the superconducting phase difference at its ends, the current–phase relation. The sharp sawtooth-shaped phase-modulated current–phase relation we find demonstrates that transport occurs selectively along two ballistic edges of the nanowire. In addition, we show that a magnetic field induces 0–π transitions and ϕ0-junction behaviour, providing a way to manipulate the phase of the supercurrent-carrying edge states and generate spin supercurrents.},
