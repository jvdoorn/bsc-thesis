  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏω. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏω)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0°K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

  abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the spatial distribution of magnetic fields and Meissner screening currents in two-dimensional (2D) superconductors and mesoscopic thin film superconducting devices is critical to interpreting the results of magnetic measurements of such systems. Here, we introduce SuperScreen, an open-source Python package for simulating the response of 2D superconductors to trapped flux and applied time-independent or quasi-DC magnetic fields for any value of the effective magnetic penetration depth, Λ. Given an applied magnetic field, SuperScreen solves the 2D London equation using an efficient matrix inversion method [1], [2] to obtain the Meissner currents and magnetic fields in and around structures composed of one or more superconducting thin films of arbitrary geometry. SuperScreen can be used to model screening effects and calculate self- and mutual-inductance in thin film superconducting devices.

  abstract = {We have studied Superconductor-Ferromagnet-Superconductor (SFS) Nb-CuNi-Nb Josephson junctions that can transition between the 0 junction and the π junction states with temperature. By direct measurement of the current-phase relation (CPR) we have determined that the critical current of some SFS junctions changes sign as a function of temperature, indicating the π junction behavior. The CPR was de- termined by incorporating the junction into an rf SQUID geometry coupled to a dc SQUID magnetometer, allowing measurement of the junction phase difference. No evidence for the second-order Josephson tunneling, that was predicted by a number of theories to be observable near the 0-π transition temperature, was found in the CPR. In non-uniform 0-π SFS junctions with spatial variations in the effective bar- rier thickness, our data is consistent with spontaneous currents circulating around the 0-π boundaries. These spontaneous currents give rise to Shapiro steps in the current- voltage characteristics at half-integer Josephson voltages when the rf-modulation is added to the bias current. The degree of 0-π junction non-uniformity was deter- mined from measurements of the critical current vs. applied magnetic flux patterns. Scanning SQUID Microscope imaging of superconducting arrays with SFS junctions revealed spontaneous currents circulating in the arrays in the π junction state below the 0-π transition temperature.},

It is also called the Gaussian unit system, Gaussian-cgs units, or often just cgs units. The term "cgs units" is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: there are several variants of cgs with conflicting definitions of electromagnetic quantities and units. SI units predominate in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units. Alternative unit systems also exist. Conversions between quantities in Gaussian and SI units are not direct unit conversions, because the quantities themselves are defined differently in each system. This means that the equations expressing physical laws of electromagnetism—such as Maxwell's—will change depending on the system of units employed. As an example, quantities that are dimensionless in one system may have dimension in the other.},

Controlling their behavior, however, requires understanding their electrostatic environment and electronic structure. Here we study gated InAs nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells. By measuring current-phase relations (CPR) and comparing them with analytical and numerical calculations, we show that we can tune the number of modes, determine the transparency of each mode, and tune into regimes in which electron-electron interactions are apparent, indicating the presence of a quantum dot. To take into account electrostatic and geometrical effects, we perform microscopic self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson numerical simulations, revealing the energy spectrum of Andreev states in the junction as well as their spatial distribution. Our work systematically demonstrates the effect of device geometry, gate voltage and phase bias on mode behavior, providing new insights into ongoing experimental efforts and predictive device design.},

In our scheme the planar, ungroundplaned, inductive loop of the dc SQUID acts as the wide single turn primary of a thin-film transformer. The input coil consists of a multiple-turn secondary in the form of a spiral stripline fabricated directly above the primary. The two tunnel junctions are located at the outside edge of the SQUID loop. A low inductance stripline structure connects the junctions to the region of high current flow in the SQUID loop. We have evaluated this coupling scheme experimentally in SQUIDs with 10-turn, 19-turn, 50-turn, and 100-turn input coils. All have mutual inductances per turn of approximately 80 pH, in good agreement with numerical calculations. Detailed measurements on the 50-turn SQUID gave a mutual inductance M of 3.8 nH, an input coil inductance Liof 190 nH, a SQUID self inductance of L of 89 pH, and a coupling constant k2= M2/LiL of 0.86.

When the dimensions of such weak links are sufficiently small, the Josephson effect is observed in them, in other words, a single-valued and 2π -periodic relationship exists between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference σ of the electrodes. With increasing dimensions, this relationship has a tendency to deviate gradually from the Josephson behavior. This deviation varies, depending on whether the weak link material is a superconductor or a normal metal. The various known types of weak links are described, and special mention is made of those weak links which are most suitable for physical investigations and have various practical applications. The data on the nonstationary (ac) processes in weak links, when the phase difference varies with time, are analyzed. In conclusion the existing concepts about the processes in weak links are briefly summarized and the most urgent outstanding problems are outlined.},

The nanoSQUIDs are fabricated by epitaxial growth of 120 nm-thick films of the high-transition temperature cuprate superconductor YBCO               via               pulsed laser deposition on MgO bicrystal substrates with 24° misorientation angle, followed by sputtering of               d               Au               = 65 nm thick Au. Nanopatterning is performed by Ga focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The SQUID performance is comparable to devices on SrTiO               3               (STO), as demonstrated by electric transport and noise measurements at 4.2 K. MgO has orders of magnitude smaller dielectric permittivity than STO;               i.e.               , one may avoid Au as a resistively shunting layer to reduce the intrinsic thermal flux noise of the nanoSQUIDs. However, we find that the Au layer is important for avoiding degradation during FIB milling. Hence, we compare devices with different               d               Au               produced by thinning the Au layer               via               Ar ion milling after FIB patterning. We find that the reduction of               d               Au               yields an increase in junction resistance, however at the expense of a reduction of the critical current and increase in SQUID inductance. This results in an estimated thermal flux noise that is almost independent of               d               Au               . However, for two devices on MgO with 65 nm-thick Au, we find an order of magnitude lower low-frequency excess noise as compared to nanoSQUIDs on STO or those on MgO with reduced               d               Au               . For one of those devices we obtain with bias-reversal readout ultra-low flux noise of ∼175 n               Φ               0               Hz               −1/2               down to ∼10 Hz.},

The variation was more rapid than expected from the BCS theory of superconductivity, in contrast to the situation in previously measured superconductors where it was less rapid. Just as in the previous cases, the results here can be understood in terms of a variation of the energy gap different from that predicted by the BCS theory. A comparison with the energy gap deduced by Dobbs and Perz from their ultrasonic-attenuation measurements is given. The penetration depth at absolute zero, λ(0), is estimated from the present results to be 470±50 Å, while the London penetration depth λL(0) is 390±50 Å.},

In two-dimensional insulators, a consequence of this topological protection is the ballistic nature of the one-dimensional helical edge states. One demonstration of ballisticity is the quantized Hall conductance. Here we provide another demonstration of ballistic transport, in the way the edge states carry a supercurrent. The system we have investigated is a micrometre-long monocrystalline bismuth nanowire with topological surfaces, that we connect to two superconducting electrodes. We have measured the relation between the Josephson current flowing through the nanowire and the superconducting phase difference at its ends, the current–phase relation. The sharp sawtooth-shaped phase-modulated current–phase relation we find demonstrates that transport occurs selectively along two ballistic edges of the nanowire. In addition, we show that a magnetic field induces 0–π transitions and ϕ0-junction behaviour, providing a way to manipulate the phase of the supercurrent-carrying edge states and generate spin supercurrents.},

The control mechanism is based on hot phonons which are injected into the superconducting microbridges from close proximity, but electrically isolated, normal-metal constrictions. We have also developed a one-dimensional computer model to analyze the behavior of micro-SQUID devices including situations in which we modify the asymmetry of the device. We show from the model that the experimental results are consistent with a change in effective length of the microbridge junctions with respect to the coherence length of the film. The experimental data, and its interpretation in relation to the micro-SQUID model, confirm that this technique, based on hot-phonon irradiation for controlling the critical current in Dayem bridge Josephson junctions, is compatible with the Josephson effect and a feasible method for post-fabrication parameter control in superconducting circuits using Dayem bridge Josephson junctions.},

State-of-the-art current imaging setups revolve around SQUIDon-tip (SOT) probes, that scan over a sample to locally measure magnetic fields and temperature. The resolution of such systems is presently limited by the lack of a robust method to control the probe-sample distance. In this thesis, we develop probes for hybrid microscopy that combine SOT with STM. We theoretically investigate interesting systems, and find that our approach would considerably improve on past magnetic investigations of vortex matter. We use focused-ion-beam milling to fabricate SOT probes on top of a commercial AFM-cantilever, and show these to be very sensitive to changes in applied magnetic field and temperature. We develop a novel readout scheme to simultaneously measure a magnetic and a tunneling signal. We present a proof-of-concept STMSOT probe that displays magnetic sensitivity inside a cryogenic STM setup, and use it as an STM probe to see the topography of a NbSe2 crystal. Our approach will culminate in the development of a STMSOT setup in the near future.},

Our observation of Shapiro steps in the dissipative branch shows that a finite Josephson coupling exists in the dissipative state. Although the nanobridge is heated, our model shows that the temperature remains below the critical temperature. This work provides evidence that Josephson behavior can still exist in thermally hysteretic weak-link devices and will allow extension of the temperature range over which nanobridge-based single-flux-quantum circuits, micron-sized superconducting quantum interference devices (i.e., nanoSQUIDs), and Josephson voltage standards can be used.},

Direct current-phase relation measurements, as well as Josephson interferometry, non-vanishing supercurrent and half-integer Shapiro steps at the 0-\$\textbackslash pi\$ transition self-consistently point to an intrinsic second harmonic term, making it possible to rule out common alternative origins of half-periodic behavior.

  abstract = {Magnetic imaging plays an essential part in measuring magnetic sources, whether they are nanoparticles, superconductor vortices, edge currents, or something else. Current techniques either lack the necessary sensitivity and spatial resolution or are too invasive to use in many applications. Scanning SQUIDs are non-invasive and have excellent sensitivity, but operate at a large distance from the surface. By integrating a SQUID into a Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) we will be able to image magnetic sources within 1 nm from the surface, increasing its sensitivity and spatial resolution. It also allows us to simultaneously gather topographic information, something no other scanning SQUID can do. To achieve this, a new production method is developed to create a SQUID on top of a sharp tip. To get a continuous superconducting connection across the surface of the tip, Molybdenum Germanium is used as a superconductor, with silver SNS junctions to prevent hysteresis. Measurements on larger MoGe-Ag SQUIDs show that this design could achieve a theoretical spin sensitivity of 1 μB/ Hz at 4.2 K, with a spatial resolution of 30 nm.},

A consequence of this symmetry is the possible existence of superconducting domains of opposite chirality. At the boundary of such domains, the locally suppressed condensate can produce an intrinsic Josephson junction. Here, we provide evidence of such junctions using mesoscopic rings, structured from Sr2RuO4 single crystals. Our order parameter simulations predict such rings to host stable domain walls across their arms. This is verified with transport experiments on loops, with a sharp transition at 1.5\,K, which show distinct critical current oscillations with periodicity corresponding to the flux quantum. In contrast, loops with broadened transitions at around 3\,K are void of such junctions and show standard Little–Parks oscillations. Our analysis demonstrates the junctions are of intrinsic origin and makes a compelling case for the existence of superconducting domains.},
