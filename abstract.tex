This thesis presents a method to measure the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction based on~\cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}. The junction under study is incorporated into a superconducting loop that is inductively coupled to a dc-SQUID. The flux measured by the dc-SQUID is proportional to the junctions phase. By sweeping the current through junctions loop it is possible to directly measure the current-phase relation with a linear background. The linear background depends on the loops inductance and can be subtracted in the analysis. The thesis outlines several important considerations and constraints of this method. Furthermore we provide current-phase measurements of a superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junction. It shows a qualitative change in shape as well as a quantitative change in amplitude of the current-phase relation in line with theory.
