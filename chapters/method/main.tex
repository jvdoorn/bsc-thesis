% Method largely based on Frolov 2004.
% Uses a superconducting loop with a junction inductively coupled to a dc-SQUID magnetometer
Our method is based on \citeauthor{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}\cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004,frolovCurrentphaseRelationsJosephson2005}. The junction under study is incorporated into a superconducting loop. This loop is then inductively coupled to a dc-SQUID magnetometer. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-setup} shows a schematic of the setup. By passing a current through the junction's loop it causes a flux proportional to the phase. The flux can be measured using the inductively coupled dc-SQUID. It also allows us to determine the current through the junction. This means we have all the information we need in order to reconstruct the CPR. This chapter first walks through the analysis method and provides arguments for the used assumptions and relations. Subsequently we provide experimental details about the production process of our samples.

\section{Analysis method}
\label{sec:analysis-method}
Our method requires little to no analysis, which immediately highlights one of the key benefits of this method. The measurements are performed by passing a current through the junction's loop $I_t$. Constrained by flux quantization and the CPR of the junction it will distribute the current between the loop and the junction:
\begin{equation}
	I_t = I_s + I_l
\end{equation}
This can be seen by applying Ohm's law to the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-setup}. By simultaneously measuring $V_s$ we are able to determine $\Phi_s$. Using the dc-SQUID's flux we can determine both $\gamma$ and $\Phi_l$. More details on this can be found in Section~\ref{sec:flux-phase-relation} and Section~\ref{sec:magnetic-coupling}.
\begin{equation}
	I_l = \frac{\Phi_s}{M} \qquad \Phi_l = \frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{equation}
Assuming $\gamma$ to be proportional to $\Phi_l$ we find the phase:
\begin{equation}
	\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\Phi_l = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{equation}
Arguments for the proportionality between $\gamma$ and $\Phi_l$ are provided in Section~\ref{sec:figure-of-merit}. Since we control $I_t$ and indirectly measured $I_s$ we can see that:
\begin{equation}
	I_s = I_t - I_l = I_t - \frac{\Phi_s}{M}
\end{equation}
The value for $L_l$ can be determined numerically by determining the static magnetic response of the superconducting rings. For this purpose \texttt{SuperScreen} was used. For more details see \cite{bishop-vanhornSuperScreenOpensourcePackage2022}. The numerical value might not match the true value, but is also possible to extract $L_l$ from the data by exploiting the fact that the current-phase relation must be $2\pi$ periodic, see Section~\ref{sec:josephson-effect}. Similarly the value for the mutual inductance can be measured indirectly by determining the linear trend we see between $\Phi_s$ and $I_t$. Figure~\ref{fig:sinusoidal-CPR-prediction} shows an example of what the data looks like for a perfectly sinusoidal CPR. The parameters are given in the caption of the figure.

\subsection{Relation between flux and phase}
\label{sec:flux-phase-relation}
Using flux quantization and the gauge-invariant phase we can derive a relation between the flux $\Phi_l$ and $\gamma$. For details please see Appendix~\ref{app:derivation-phase-flux-relation}.
\begin{equation}
	\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\left(\Phi_l + \lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l} \right)
	\label{eqn:phase-flux-relation}
\end{equation}
We can express $\Phi_l$ in terms of $I_s$ and $I_l$:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_sL_{JJ}  + I_lL_l
\end{equation}
Where $L_{JJ}$ and $L_l$ are the inductances of the Josephson junction and loop respectively\footnote{This is not the so called Josephson inductance but purely a magnetic inductance and not a kinetic inductance.}. Strictly speaking $L_{JJ}$ is more of mutual inductance between the loop and the junction. However, in practice it does not matter. We will assume that $L_{JJ} \ll L_l$. This is also done by \citeauthor{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004} (see~\cite{frolovCurrentphaseRelationsJosephson2005,frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}) and often in literature when discussing dc-SQUIDs (see par example~\cite{clarkeSQUIDHandbook2004}). This means our final equation for the loop flux becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_lL_l
\end{equation}

\subsection{Proportionality between $\gamma$ and $\Phi_l$}
\label{sec:figure-of-merit}
The goal is to determine $\gamma$ by measuring $\Phi_l$. The two are only proportional however if the integral term in Equation~\ref{eqn:phase-flux-relation} is negligible. As such we have the requirement that:
\begin{equation*}
	\lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l} \ll \Phi_l
\end{equation*}
We define a figure of merit, $\delta$, that weighs the two terms. The requirement that $\gamma \propto \Phi_l$ is satisfied when $|\delta| \ll 1$.
\begin{equation}
	\delta = \frac{\lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l}}{\Phi_l}
\end{equation}
For a square and round geometry the integral part can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
	\int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l} = \begin{cases}
		2\pi r \tilde{j} I_l, &\text{round} \\
		8r \tilde{j} I_l, &\text{square}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $r$ is the radius (half the diameter) and $\tilde{j} = \tilde{j}(d, w, \lambda)$ a geometric factor in \unit{\per\square\meter}. The value of $\tilde{j}$ can be calculated numerically and details can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:derivation-geometric-factor-j}. The loop flux can be expressed as $\Phi_l = I_lL_l$, this allows us to rewrite the figure of merit as:
\begin{equation}
	\delta = \frac{\lambda^2\mu_0\tilde{j}}{L_l} \cdot \begin{cases}
		2\pi r, &\text{round} \\
		8r, &\text{square}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eqn:figure-of-merit}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the figure of merit only depends on the device geometry and is independent of experimental parameters such as $I_l$. The inductance of the loop can be estimated numerically using SuperScreen.\cite{bishop-vanhornSuperScreenOpensourcePackage2022}

\subsection{Magnetic coupling}
\label{sec:magnetic-coupling}
The dc-SQUID is inductively coupled to the junction's loop. This means that by measuring $\Phi_s$ we can determine $\Phi_l$ which is then used to determine $\gamma$ and $I_l$. In the experiment a current is passed through the junction's loop. Using the mutual inductance we obtain a relation between $I_l$ and $\Phi_s$:
\begin{equation}
	I_l = \frac{\Phi_s}{M}
\end{equation}
Using the inductance of the junction's loop we then also find $\Phi_l$:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_lL_l = \frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{equation}

Again the (mutual) inductance can be estimated numerically in SuperScreen.\cite{bishop-vanhornSuperScreenOpensourcePackage2022} The numerical simulation does not take into account the possibility of magnetic lensing.\cite{prigozhin3DSimulationSuperconducting2018} As such the mutual inductance might be larger in practice. This means that the dc-SQUID might react more sensitively to changes in the junction's loop.

\section{Sample geometries}
The diameter of the dc-SQUID is chosen such that the periodicity of the SQUID interference pattern is on the order of a few \unit{\milli\tesla}. This means the effective diameter should be around \qtyrange{1}{2}{\micro\meter}. Furthermore, the width of the loop together with the thickness of the superconductor determine the geometric factor $\tilde{j}$, they are chosen such that the figure of merit is sufficiently small. In practice this means that the width is around \qty{0.3}{\micro\meter} and the thickness around \qty{100}{\nano\meter}. Details on this can be found on a per sample basis later as well as details on the type of junction.

\section{Sample fabrication}
\label{sec:method-sample-fabrication}
We use a \ce{Si} substrate of approximately \qty{1}{\square\centi\meter}. The substrate is cleaned by dusting it off using a pressurised nitrogen gas and rinsed for \qty{30}{\minute} in acetone in an ultrasonic cleaner. To get rid of acetone residue we rinse it using IPA for \qty{5}{\minute} in the ultrasonic cleaner. We spincoat the substrate with a layer of PMMA 600K followed by a layer of PMMA 950K. After this we pattern the sample using electron-beam lithography. Due to the double PMMA layers, development leaves an undercut.

After this process we use dc-sputtering to deposit a \qty{90}{\nano\meter} layer of \ce{Nb} and cap it using \qty{7}{\nano\meter} of \ce{Au}. The thickness of the \ce{Nb} is based on estimations for our figure of merit. The \ce{Nb} is sputtered in a ultra-high vacuum magnetron sputtering setup. It has a base pressure of \qty{\leq1E-9}{\milli\bar} and a argon deposition pressure of \qty{4e-3}{\milli\bar}. Lift-off is done using acetone. A final rinsing is done using IPA to remove any residues. Using this process we create all the coarse structures. These include the contact pads, leads to the contact pad and a central square in which we will make our fine geometries. Figure~\ref{fig:lithography} schematically shows the lithography and sputtering process.

The figure is not to scale.}

\end{figure}

The finer geometries in the central square are created using focussed ion beam (FIB). They are used to cut away the \ce{Nb} and \ce{Au}, leaving just the substrate. The advantage of using the FIB is less PMMA poisoning in our \ce{Nb}. Figure~\ref{fig:FIB} schematically shows the FIB process.
