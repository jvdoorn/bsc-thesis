% Uses a superconducting loop with a junction inductively coupled to a dc-SQUID magnetometer
Our method is mostly inspired by \Citeauthor{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004} \citeyear{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}. We incorporate the junction whose CPR we want to measure into a superconducting loop. This loop is then inductively coupled to a dc-SQUID magnetometer. See Fig. \ref{fig:schematic-setup} for a schematic of the setup. This chapter will outline the ideas behind the setup and provide arguments for the chosen geometries.

The current $I_t$ is controlled externally. The flux through the two loops is denoted by $\Phi_l$ and $\Phi_s$. The junction whose CPR we want to measure is part of the left loop.

\section{Relation between flux and phase}
Using flux quantization and the gauge-invariant phase we can derive a relation between the flux $\Phi_l$ and $\gamma$. For details please see Section \ref{app:derivation-phase-flux-relation}.
\begin{equation}
	\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\left(\Phi_l + \lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l} \right)
	\label{eqn:phase-flux-relation}
\end{equation}
We can express $\Phi_l$ in terms of $I_s$ and $I_l$:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_sL_{JJ}  + I_lL_l
\end{equation}
Where $L_{JJ}$ and $L_l$ are the inductances of the Josephson junction and loop respectively\footnote{This is not the so called Josephson inductance but purely a magnetic inductance and not a kinetic inductance.}. We will assume that $L_{JJ} \ll L_l$, this is also done by \citeauthor{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004} (see \cite{frolovCurrentphaseRelationsJosephson2005,frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}) and often in literature when discussing dc-SQUIDs (see par example \cite{clarkeSQUIDHandbook2004}). This means our final equation for the loop flux becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_lL_l
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figure of merit}
\label{sec:figure-of-merit}
In order for $\gamma$ to be proportional to $\Phi_l$ the second term must be negligible in Eq. \ref{eqn:phase-flux-relation}. We define a figure of merit $\delta$ which we require to be $\ll 1$.
\begin{equation}
	\delta = \frac{\lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l}}{\Phi_l}
\end{equation}
For a square and round geometry we can rewrite the integral part in the following way:
\begin{equation}
	\int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l} = \begin{cases}
		2\pi r \tilde{j} I_l, &\text{round} \\
		8r \tilde{j} I_l, &\text{square}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $r$ is the radius (half the diameter) and $\tilde{j} = \tilde{j}(d, w, \lambda)$ a geometric factor in \unit{\per\square\meter}. The value of $\tilde{j}$ can be calculated numerically and details can be found in Section \ref{app:derivation-geometric-factor-j}.

The loop flux can simply be rewritten as $\Phi_l = I_lL_l$, this allows us to rewrite the figure of merit as:
\begin{equation}
	\delta = \frac{\lambda^2\mu_0\tilde{j}}{L_l} \cdot \begin{cases}
		2\pi r, &\text{round} \\
		8r, &\text{square}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eqn:figure-of-merit}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the figure of merit is independent of the amount of current ($I_l$) passed through the loop, as such it is always valid. The inductance of the loop can be determined using a simulation done in SuperScreen\cite{bishop-vanhornSuperScreenOpensourcePackage2022}.

\subsection{Magnetic coupling}
\label{sec:magnetic-coupling}
There is not a $1:1$ relation between $\Phi_l$ and $\Phi_s$. Since we are passing a current through the junction loop, we can use the mutual inductance to determine the flux it causes in the dc-SQUID loop. We can simulate the value for the mutual inductance using SuperScreen\cite{bishop-vanhornSuperScreenOpensourcePackage2022}. In the experiment the mutual inductance can be measured indirectly by determining the linear trend we see in $\Phi_s$. Using this mutual inductance we can determine the junction loop current:
\begin{equation}
	I_l = \frac{\Phi_s}{M}
\end{equation}
We can then use the inductance of the junction loop to find the junction loop flux:
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_l = I_lL_l = \frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{equation}

This is a naive approach that does not take into account the possibility of magnetic lensing\cite{prigozhin3DSimulationSuperconducting2018}. As such the mutual inductance might be larger in practice, meaning that the dc-SQUID reacts more sensitively to change in the junction loop.

\section{Sample geometries}
The diameter of the dc-SQUID is chosen such that the periodicity of the SQUID interference pattern is on the order of a few \unit{\milli\tesla}. This means the effective diameter should be around \qtyrange{1}{2}{\micro\meter}. Furthermore, the width of the loop together with the thickness of the superconductor determine the geometric factor $\tilde{j}$, they are chosen such that the figure of merit is sufficiently small. In practice this means that the width is around \qty{0.3}{\micro\meter} and the thickness around \qty{100}{\nano\meter}. Details on this can be found on a per sample basis later as well as details on the type of junction.

\subsection{Sample fabrication}
\label{sec:method-sample-fabrication}
We use \ce{Si} wafer of approximately \qty{1}{\square\centi\meter}. The wafer is cleaned by dusting it off using a pressurised nitrogen gas and rinsed for \qty{30}{\minute} in acetone in an ultrasonic bath. To get rid of acetone residue we finally rinse it using IPA for \qty{5}{\minute} in ultrasonic bath. The wafer then spin coated with PMMA 600K, baked at \qty{180}{\celsius} for 5 minutes, coated with PMMA 950K and then baked again. We then use electron beam lithography to etch our patterns. The PMMA is a negative resist, so exposed regions can later be removed. After this process we use dc-sputtering to deposit around \qty{100}{\nano\meter} of \ce{Nb} and cap it using \qty{7}{\nano\meter} of \ce{Au}. The remaining PMMA is finally removed using acetone in an ultrasonic bath and rinsed with IPA. See Figure~\ref{fig:lithography}. Using this process we create all the coarse structures, these include the contact pads, leads to the contact pad and a central square in which we will make our fine geometries.

	\caption{Schematic depiction of the lithography and sputtering process. \textbf{a)} We start with a \ce{Si} wafer (dark grey) with a layer of PMMA 600K (\qty{0.4}{\micro\meter}) and on top of that PMMA 950K (\qty{0.4}{\micro\meter}) (yellow) and expose it to an electron beam. \textbf{b)} After exposure, we can remove the exposed regions using MIBK / IPA (1:3). \textbf{c)} We sputter the \ce{Nb} and \ce{Au} capping layer (light grey) on top the sample. \textbf{d)} In the final step we use acetone to remove the left-over PMMA leaving us with just the \ce{Nb} and \ce{Au} on top of the wafer in the desired pattern. The figure is not to scale.}
	\label{fig:lithography}
\end{figure}

The finer geometries in the central square are created using a beam of \ce{Ga+} (focussed ion beam (FIB)). They are used to cut away the \ce{Nb} and \ce{Au}, leaving just the wafer. The advantage of use the FIB is that we can achieve a higher resolution compared to lithography which is important for our junctions. See Figure~\ref{fig:FIB}.

\section{Analysis method}
Our method requires little to no analysis, which immediately highlights one of the benefits of this method. This section mainly recaps how to retrieve the CPR, $f(\gamma)$, from the measured quantities $I_t$ (which is controlled in the experiment) and $\Phi_s$. By determining the linear trend in $\Phi_s$, as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:magnetic-coupling}, we can determine the current through the junction loop as well as the flux of the junction loop:
\begin{align}
	I_l = \frac{\Phi_s}{M} \qquad \Phi_l = I_lL_l = \frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{align}
By applying Ohms laws to the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-setup} we see $I_t = I_s + I_l$, allowing us to determine the current through the junction:
\begin{equation}
	I_s = I_t - I_l = I_t - \frac{\Phi_s}{M}
\end{equation}

As a final step we use Equation~\ref{eqn:phase-flux-relation} and find:
\begin{equation}
	\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\Phi_l = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0}\frac{L_l}{M}\Phi_s
\end{equation}
Here we have neglected the term $\lambda^2\mu_0 \int \vec{J}\cdot d \vec{l}$ assuming our figure or merit is sufficiently small as highlighted in Sec. \ref{sec:figure-of-merit}. The value for $L_l$ can be determined numerically. However, as this might not match the true value it is also possible to extract $L_l$ from the data. We can do so by exploiting the fact that the current-phase relation must be periodic in $\Phi_0$, see Section~\ref{sec:josephson-effect}.
