\chapter*{Conventions}
In this thesis we take $e = |e|$ meaning the electron has a charge of $-e$. The charge of a Cooper pair (denoted $e^*$ in \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}) is then $-2e$. The mass of a Cooper pair (denoted $m^*$ in \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}) is two times the mass of a single electron, denoted by $2m_e$ in this thesis.
