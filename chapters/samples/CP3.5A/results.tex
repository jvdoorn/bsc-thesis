The sample sadly enough exploded and we were unable to produce any (significant) results. Its remains are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP3.5A-remains}. The location of the damage is unexpected. It would be more logical if the junctions had exploded as those are the most fragile due to higher current densities.

There is one noteworthy result for this sample. During our measurements it appeared as though the sample has two critical temperatures. The RT-curves are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP3.5A_RT_curves}. The bulk transition of the dc-SQUID appears to be around \qty{7.5}{\kelvin}. The junction's loop transitions around \qty{6}{\kelvin}. In hindsight we think the cause is a significant delay between the sample's thermometer and the sample itself. The delay has not been noted before as we took resistance measurements every few seconds instead of waiting for temperature stability. This could easily be checked if it the sample was still alive.

The main figure highlights the superconducting transitions. The junction's loop resistance is quite sharp. The dc-SQUID transition again has a `tail'. A reason for the difference in critical temperature is given in the main text.}

Regardless of these setbacks we do still think that the ideas behind the sample are promising. We suspect that the damage is caused by using two current sources in parallel. Future experiments might want to use a summing amplifier combined with a VI-converter or a Howland circuit.
