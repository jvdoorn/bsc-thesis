The sample sadly enough exploded and we were unable to produce any (significant) results. Its remains are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP3.5A-remains}. The location of the damage is a bit unexpected. It would me more logical if the junctions had exploded as those are the most fragile structures.

There is one noteworthy result for this sample. During our measurements it appeared as though the sample has two critical temperatures. The RT-curves are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP3.5A_RT_curves}. The bulk transition of the dc-SQUID appears to be around \qty{7.5}{\kelvin}. The junction's loop transitions around \qty{6}{\kelvin}. The results is particularly puzzling because the bulk sizes are the same; the materials were deposited simultaneously; and there were no significant exposure differences during FIB. Compared to the RT-curves of our previous sample it seems that the dc-SQUID is the outlier. Its resistance before the transition is much higher (almost \qty{20}{\ohm} compared to \qty{5}{\ohm}) and the critical temperature is higher than before. In hindsight we think the cause is a significant delay between the sample's thermometer and the sample itself. The delay has not been noted before as we took period measurements instead of waiting for temperature stability. This could easily be checked if it the sample was still alive.

The main figure highlights the superconducting transitions. The junction's loop resistance is quite sharp. The dc-SQUID transition again has a `tail'. A reason for the difference in critical temperature is given in the main text.}

Regardless of these setbacks we do still think that the ideas behind the sample are promising. We suspect that the damage is caused by using two current sources in parallel. Future experiments might want to use a summing amplifier combined with a VI-converter or a Howland circuit.
