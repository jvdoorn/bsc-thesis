This sample's goal was to fix the shortcomings we noticed in our first sample. The first thing we want to improve is the dc-SQUID sensitivity. To do so we intend to use SNS junctions instead of constriction junctions. We have chosen for SNS junctions because they have been used before in our group and yielded good results\cite{rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022}. Furthermore, in order to decrease the chance of shorts we use a \ce{SiO} wafer instead of \ce{Si}. Additionally, to improve the coupling between the dc-SQUID and the junction loop we used a square geometry instead of a circular one.
