This sample's goal was to fix the shortcomings of our first sample. The first thing we want to improve is the dc-SQUID sensitivity and its useable temperature range. To do so SNS junctions were used instead of constriction junctions. SNS junctions were used in our group before and yielded good results.\cite{rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022} Furthermore, in order to mitigate any chance of shorts we use a \ce{Si} with a thermal oxide on top. Additionally, to improve the coupling between the dc-SQUID and the junction's loop we used a square geometry instead of a circular one.
