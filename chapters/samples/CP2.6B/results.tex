	\caption{Temperature dependences of the 4-point resistance measured over the dc-SQUID and the junction loop. We note that just before the superconducting transition that there is a small bump in resistance of the dc-SQUID and a long `tail' before reaching \qty{0}{\ohm}. Compared to this the transition of the junction loop is much sharper.}

\end{figure}

% Long tail is characteristic for SNS or SS'S junctions due to proximity effect
% Explanation for weird bump?
% Tc is lower than previous sample because of the copper layer. Tc depends on the density of Cooper-pairs and because the Cooper pairs leak into the Cu Tc gets lower. Sauce?

	\caption{Voltage measured over the dc-SQUID for various bias currents over external magnetic field. The patterns have been fitted to a sinusoid and the slanted lines illustrate the linear response. The sensitivities in the linear regions are \qtylist{160;232;279;346}{\micro\volt/\milli\tesla} respectively. For \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} the curve has been measured twice (annotated with a \dag).}

% We note that the periodicity of the raw data does not seem constant
% There is a change in `phase' as if there is a varying residual background field.
% The two 380uA curves do not agree with each other

	\caption{Supper current through the junction loop over junction loop flux. We note that there is a linear background and that the size of the steps in the flux direction are roughly all $\Phi_0$.}

\end{figure}

% Conversion was done using the second 380uA calibration. Both calibrations give (within std) the same coupling between SQUID and junction loop which also matches the simulation.
% Loop flux conversion was done by using the fact that it must be Phi0 periodic, only assumption we make.
% Linear background gets extracted using a linear fit.

	\caption{Supper current through the junction loop over junction loop flux. Compared to Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_super_current_over_loop_flux} we subtracted the linear background. We note that the oscillations have a periodicity of roughly \qty{60}{\micro\ampere}.}

\end{figure}

% Linear background was extracted, yerr comes from STD in the fit.
% Pattern is quite noisy, definately not useable as a result.
% 60uA is too big to get a non hysteric measurement.
