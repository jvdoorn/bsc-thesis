Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_RT_curves} shows the RT-curves for the junction loop and dc-SQUID. We note that the critical temperature for the bulk of the sample is lower (\qty{7}{\kelvin}) compared to the first sample (\qty{8}{\kelvin}). This can be explained by the proximity effect due to the interface between the \ce{Cu} and \ce{Nb}.\cite{cirilloSuperconductingProximityEffect2005} The longer `tail' is characteristic for SNS junctions as the normal metal slowly proximises.

We note that just before the superconducting transition that there is a small bump in resistance of the dc-SQUID and a long `tail' before reaching \qty{0}{\ohm}. Compared to this the transition of the junction loop is much sharper.}

Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_SQUID_calibration_curves} shows the interference pattern of the dc-SQUID for several bias currents. We note that the periodicity in the the data is roughly \qty{1}{\milli\tesla}. This matches the expected period. We furthermore note that the sensitivity in the linear regime increased by a factor 3 compared to the previous sample. The comparison is a bit unfair as this is at a bias current that is also 3 times larger. In the previous sample however, such a large bias current was simply not possible. We note two issues in these curves. First off, the period of the pattern does not seem to be constant. Secondly, the offset (in the field axis) varies a lot between curves whilst they should all be zero. Both these issues can be explained by vortices getting trapped in the magnet or sample.

When we attempted to measure the CPR we noted weird spikes in the IV-curves. We initially attributed this to vortex trapping. However, upon closer inspection these jumps are highly correlated with the actual magnetic field produced by the magnet. Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_PPMS_magnetic_field_drift} shows a clear correlation between the dc-SQUID voltage and the magnetic field as measured by the magnet. Even though we have a constant setpoint of \qty{0}{\milli\tesla} we see quite some drift. This is because the magnet does not have a persistent mode but instead uses a feedback loop. This feedback loop has a dead band of \qty{50}{\micro\tesla}. Changing the setpoint of the field or the rate of change did not affect the effect significantly.

\end{figure}

In an attempt to fix the `noise' caused by the feedback loop, we turned off the magnet. Unfortunately, it never turned back on as the magnet controller was broken. A downside of this, is that we were also no longer able to read out the value of the field. We decided to perform a CPR measurement again by using a constant bias of \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} for the dc-SQUID, sweeping a current through the junction loop and then measuring the voltage over the dc-SQUID. It should be mentioned that during these measurements there appeared to be a lot of drift causing measurement to differ widely. We suspect that an external magnetic field was responsible for this. 

Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_SQUID_voltage_over_total_current} shows the raw data from one of the CPR measurements. We note a clear periodicity in the signal of around \qty{200}{\micro\ampere} and a somewhat linear trend on top of that. We present this specific measurement because it has no jumps in the dc-SQUID voltage, has a sufficiently small sample spacing, covers a wide enough range to see several periods and measured both positive and negative currents. Different sample spacings did not affect measured periodicity.

Using the second calibration curve for \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} bias current we converted the dc-SQUID voltage to a flux. We have chosen to set the horizontal offset of this calibration to zero as there should be barely any background field. The difference in the two calibration curves also highlights that the horizontal offset was difficult to reproduce. The linear trend in the dc-SQUID's flux is the mutual inductance. A linear fit determined the the mutual inductance to be \qty{-0.339\pm0.005}{\pico\henry}. This value is almost twice as large as the simulated value found in Table~\ref{tab:CP2.6B-geometries}. Similarly, we can determine the junction loop inductance by exploiting the fact that the periodicity must be $\Phi_0$ periodic. We find the inductance of the junction loop to be \qty{6\pm1}{\pico\henry}. This is twice the simulated value found in Table~\ref{tab:CP2.6B-geometries}.

We note that the amplitude of the oscillations is around \qty{60}{\micro\ampere} and the pattern contains quite steep slopes. We furthermore note that the pattern `dips' down a bit and does not oscillate around the same mean. Since the pattern does seem somewhat symmetric around \qty{0}{\micro\ampere} this is probably an artefact from the fact we set the horizontal offset to 0.

It is clear that two major issues with this result is the lack of resolution. Future measurements should take much smaller steps. Furthermore, because it was not possible to keep the dc-SQUID in the linear response region we achieved a suboptimal sensitivity and calibration.
