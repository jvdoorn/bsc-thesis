Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_RT_curves} shows the RT-curves for the junction's loop and dc-SQUID. The critical temperature for the bulk of the sample is lower (\qty{7}{\kelvin}) compared to the first sample (\qty{8}{\kelvin}). This can be explained by the proximity effect due to the interface between the \ce{Cu} and \ce{Nb}.\cite{cirilloSuperconductingProximityEffect2005} The longer `tail' is characteristic for SNS junctions due to the proximity effect.

       Temperature dependences of the 4-point resistance measured over the dc-SQUID and the junction's loop. We note that just before the superconducting transition that there is a small bump in resistance of the dc-SQUID and a long `tail' before reaching \qty{0}{\ohm}. The transition of the junction's loop is much sharper in comparison.

Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_SQUID_calibration_curves} shows the interference pattern of the dc-SQUID for several bias currents. The periodicity in the the data is roughly \qty{1}{\milli\tesla}. This matches the expected period. Furthermore, the sensitivity in the linear regime increased by a factor 10 compared to the previous sample. The comparison is a bit unfair as the bias current was 3 times as large. In the previous sample however, such a large bias current was simply not possible. There are two issues with this result. First off, the period of the pattern does not seem to be constant. Secondly, the offset (in the field axis) varies a lot between curves whilst they should all be zero. Both these issues can be explained by vortices getting trapped in the magnet or sample.

During an attempt to measure the CPR, the IV-curves showed anomalous spikes. Initially we attributed this to vortex trapping. However, upon closer inspection these jumps are exactly correlated with the actual magnetic field reported by the magnet controller. Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_PPMS_magnetic_field_drift} shows a clear overlap between the dc-SQUID voltage and the magnetic field as measured by the magnet. Even though a constant setpoint of \qty{0}{\milli\tesla} was used, there is quite some drift. This is because the magnet does not have a persistent mode but instead uses a feedback loop to keep a constant field. This feedback loop has a dead band of \qty{50}{\micro\tesla}. Changing the setpoint of the field or the rate of change did not have a significant effect.

\end{figure}

In an attempt to fix the `noise' caused by the feedback loop, the magnet was turned off. Unfortunately, it never turned back on as the magnet controller was broken. A downside of this, is that it was no longer possible to read out the value of the field. An attempt was made to measure the CPR again by using a constant bias current of \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} for the dc-SQUID. It should be mentioned that during these measurements there appeared to be a lot of drift causing measurements to differ widely. An external magnetic field was likely responsible for this. Possibly this was still caused by the magnet controller as, later on when it was replaced, this did not seem to be an issue anymore.

Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_SQUID_voltage_over_total_current} shows the raw data from one of the CPR measurements. There is a clear periodicity in the signal of around \qty{200}{\micro\ampere} and a somewhat linear trend on top of that. This specific measurement is presented because it has no unexpected jumps in the dc-SQUID voltage; has a sufficiently small sample spacing; covers a wide enough range to see several periods; and measured both positive and negative currents. Using different sample spacings did not affect the measured periodicity.

\end{figure}

Using the second calibration curve for \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} bias current we converted the dc-SQUID voltage to a flux. A linear fit is used to determine the mutual inductance to be $\qty{-0.339\pm0.005}{\pico\henry}$. This is almost twice as large as the simulated value in Table~\ref{tab:CP2.6B-geometries}. Similarly, by exploiting the $\Phi_0$-periodicity of the CPR, the junction's loop's inductance was found to be \qty{6\pm1}{\pico\henry}. Again this is almost twice the as large as the simulated value in Table~\ref{tab:CP2.6B-geometries}. Using the proportionality between $\Phi_l$ and $\gamma$ the flux was converted to a phase. Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_super_current_over_phase} shows the result of this analysis.

The amplitude of the oscillations is around \qty{60}{\micro\ampere} and the pattern contains quite steep slopes. Furthermore, the pattern `dips' down a bit and does not oscillate around the same mean. Most likely this is because the dc-SQUID is not biased in its linear regime and thus a measurement artefact.

It is clear that two major issues with this result are the lack of resolution and the calibration. Future measurements should take much smaller steps. Furthermore, because it was not possible to keep the dc-SQUID in the linear response region the sensitivity and calibration were suboptimal.
