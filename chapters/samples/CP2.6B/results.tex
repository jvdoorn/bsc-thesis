	\caption{Temperature dependences of the 4-point resistance measured over the dc-SQUID and the junction loop. We note that just before the superconducting transition that there is a small bump in resistance of the dc-SQUID and a long `tail' before reaching \qty{0}{\ohm}. Compared to this the transition of the junction loop is much sharper.}

\end{figure}

% Long tail is characteristic for SNS or SS'S junctions due to proximity effect
% Explanation for weird bump?
% Tc is lower than previous sample because of the copper layer. Tc depends on the density of Cooper-pairs and because the Cooper pairs leak into the Cu Tc gets lower. Sauce?

	\caption{Voltage measured over the dc-SQUID for various bias currents over external magnetic field. The patterns have been fitted to a sinusoid and the slanted lines illustrate the linear response. The sensitivities in the linear regions are \qtylist{160;232;279;346}{\micro\volt/\milli\tesla} respectively. For \qty{380}{\micro\ampere} the curve has been measured twice (annotated with a \dag).}

% We note that the periodicity of the raw data does not seem constant
% There is a change in `phase' as if there is a varying residual background field.
% The two 380uA curves do not agree with each other
