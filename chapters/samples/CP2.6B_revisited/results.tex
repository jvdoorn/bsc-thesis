The sample had not been permanently stored in a desiccator. Worst case it had been exposed for a few days. An important check was thus if the sample had degraded. The RT-curve of the dc-SQUID showed no significant changes. As such it is unlikely that the sample degraded significantly. It also confirmed that all the contacts are still good.

Previously the CPR was measured at \qty{3}{\kelvin}. An increase in temperature decreases the sensitivity of our dc-SQUID and the critical current of the junction's loop. Our previous measurement has a periodicity of \qty{200}{\micro\ampere}. In order to see multiple periods it is preferable to change $I_t$ between \qty{\pm400}{\micro\ampere}. This allows us to see around 4 to 5 periods. Through trial and error we found the highest usable temperature to be \qty{3.6}{\kelvin}.

We used a bias current of \qty{300}{\micro\ampere} except for \qty{2.8}{\kelvin} where \qty{350}{\micro\ampere} was used. Near zero field the patterns seem quite stable but further out become more noisy.}

Similarly to last time, SQIs were measured for several bias currents ranging from \qtyrange{300}{350}{\micro\ampere}. The SQIs shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_revisited_SQIs}. Whilst the SQIs are far from perfect, they are usable. Near zero field the periodicity as well as the horizontal offset is reproducible. The amplitude of the oscillations is stable as well. Since the junction's loop will only create a small flux this should be sufficient. Around zero field we can approximate the oscillations as sinusoidal. After fitting it gives a sensitivity of \qtylist{491.37;189.73;326.49;410.49;419.73}{\micro\volt\per\fluxquantum} for \qtylist{2.8;3.0;3.2;3.4;3.6}{\kelvin} respectively. These are comparable to previous results. Please note that the first sensitivity is significantly higher due to a higher bias current.

\end{figure}

After the calibrations the current-phase relations were measured. They are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_revisited_CPRs}. From the slope in our data we determined the mutual inductance to be 0.4 times the simulated value in Table~\ref{tab:CP2.6B-geometries}. For the loop inductance the value is 3.5 times the simulated value. These deviations might be explained by the fact that the simulation does not take the layer of \ce{Cu} into account. Additionally these values do not match what we previously found for this sample. Possibly this is because the calibration was not optimal. The amplitude of the oscillations decreases when the temperature increases except for the measurement at \qty{3.6}{\kelvin}. We suspect that this deviation at \qty{3.6}{\kelvin} is due to a human error. A likely explanation is that a different bias current was used for the dc-SQUID compared to the bias current used for the calibration.

Ignoring the measurement at \qty{3.6}{\kelvin}, the critical current goes from \qtyrange{90}{45}{\micro\ampere} between \qtyrange{2.8}{3.4}{\kelvin}. Figure~\ref{fig:SNS_junction_predictions} shows the CPR at different temperatures for both a short diffusive and short ballistic SNS junction. Qualitatively we see that our results best match the short ballistic CPR. In either case we see that the CPR becomes more sinusoidal and that the amplitudes decrease as the temperature increases.

It is odd that that the short ballistic model qualitatively matches the data better. Especially since a gaussian pattern was observed when doing higher field measurements on the dc-SQUID. A gaussian pattern is expected with diffusive behaviour. Another possibility is that our junction is diffusive but that we are in a multi-valued regime.

Clearly the results show a few artefacts most notably at \qtylist{2.8;3.0;3.4}{\kelvin}. We attribute this to the fact that we are not in the linear regime of our dc-SQUID. We are confident that if the dc-SQUID would be biased in the linear regime that these artefacts would disappear. Additionally because we did not control our dc-SQUID's bias, it is not possible to say what point $\gamma = 0$. As such we have artificially centred the curves such that $\gamma = 0$ for $I_s=0$.
