The sample had not been permanently stored in a desiccator. An important check was thus if the sample had degraded. The RT-curve of the dc-SQUID showed no significant changes. As such it is unlikely that the sample degraded significantly. It also confirmed that all the contacts are still good.

Previously the CPR was measured at \qty{3}{\kelvin}. An increase in temperature degrades the sensitivity of our dc-SQUID and the critical current of the junction loop. We note that our measurement was approximately \qty{200}{\micro\ampere} periodic. In order to seem multiple periods it is preferable to have a critical junction around \qty{400}{\micro\ampere}. This allows us to see around 4 to 5 periods. Through trial and error we found the highest usable temperature to be \qty{3.4}{\kelvin}.

Similarly to last time we then measured SQIs for several bias currents. A bias current of \qtyrange{300}{350}{\micro\ampere} was used. They are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_revisited_SQIs}. Whilst the SQIs are far from perfect, they are usable. The curved background is due to the magnetic field dependence of the critical current of the bulk.Near zero field the periodicity as well as the horizontal offset is reproducible. The amplitude of the oscillations is stable as well. Since the junction loop will only create a small flux this should be sufficient. Around zero field we can approximate the oscillations as sinusoidal. After fitting it gives a sensitivity of \qtylist{491.37;189.73;326.49;410.49;419.73}{\micro\volt\per\fluxquantum} for \qtylist{2.8;3.0;3.2;3.4;3.6}{\kelvin} respectively. These are comparable to previous results. Please note that the first sensitivity is significantly higher due to a higher bias current.

We used a bias current of \qty{300}{\micro\ampere} except for \qty{2.8}{\kelvin} where \qty{350}{\micro\ampere} was used. Near zero field the patterns seem quite stable but further out become more noisy.}

After the calibrations the current-phase relations were measured. They are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP2.6B_revisited_CPRs}. The amplitude of the oscillations appears to decrease as the temperature increases. Except for the measurement at \qty{3.6}{\kelvin} where it increases again. We suspect that this is due to a human error. A likely explanation is that a different bias current was used for the dc-SQUID compared to the bias current used for the calibration. The change in amplitude corresponds to a change in critical current. Ignoring the measurement at \qty{3.6}{\kelvin}, the critical current goes from \qtyrange{90}{45}{\micro\ampere} between \qtyrange{2.8}{3.4}{\kelvin}. Besides the change in critical current we also note that the asymmetry changes. Both these changes are in line with theoretical models \cite{likharevSuperconductingWeakLinks1979}.

Previously we thought the steep curve was caused by a multivalued measurements. However, with these new results we think we wrong mainly because we see such a gradual transition.

Clearly the results show a few artefacts most notably at \qtylist{2.8;3.0;3.4}{\kelvin}. We attribute this to the fact that we are not in the linear regime of our dc-SQUID. We are confident that if the dc-SQUID would be biased in the linear regime that these artefacts would disappear. Additionally because we did not control our dc-SQUID's bias, it is not possible to say what point $\gamma = 0$. As such we have artificially centred the curves such that $\gamma = 0$ for $I_s=0$.
