After the failure of sample CP3 we revisited sample CP2. By increasing the temperature it is possible to lower $I_c$. This opens the possibility to go into a non-hysteric regime by decreasing the screening parameter. Refer to Section~\ref{sec:CP3.5A-fabrication} for more information. The reason this was not attempted earlier is because the magnet controller was broken. As such it was not possible to measure SQIs at higher temperatures and consequently to measure the CPR at higher temperatures. The sample has not been altered, as such the reader is referred to Section~\ref{sec:CP2.6B-fabrication} for the geometries.
