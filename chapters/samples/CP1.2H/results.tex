During the cool down of the Teslatron cryostat in which we measured the sample, we used a 4-point measurement to determine the resistance of the dc-SQUID. See Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-RT}. We note that the sample becomes superconducting at \qty{8}{\kelvin} and has a quite sharp transition. This is above the expected transition temperature of \qty{7.5}{\kelvin} which was measured before on a thin film made from the same sputtering target. This might be explained however by the fact that the \ce{Nb} target had not been used in a while\footnote{It had last been used more than a year ago when the thin film was made.}. As such it is likely that when we sputtered the thin film that it had much more contaminations. $T_c$ for pure \ce{Nb} is \qty{9.2}{\kelvin}\cite{maxfieldSuperconductingPenetrationDepth1965}, since we use sputtering it is not surprising to find a lower $T_c$.

Additionally we determined the temperature dependence of the critical current, see Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-critical-current-temperature-dependence}. We note that, similar to what we see in Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-RT}, that there are two transitions starting from \qty{7.2}{\kelvin}. The obvious one is a very sharp transition but there is a second much more subtle transition. The sharp transition is for the bulk of the superconductor (leads, contact pads, etc.) whilst the more subtle one is from the dc-SQUID's junctions. This defines the range in which we can measure our dc-SQUID when using it as a magnetometer at certain temperatures. The temperature dependence of the junction behaviour is attributed to the temperature dependence of the coherence length, see Section~\ref{sec:characteristic-length-scales}.

We measured the interference pattern of the dc-SQUID at \qty{7.6}{\kelvin}, see Figure~\ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-SQI}. The periodicity of the interference pattern is between \qtyrange{3}{3.5}{\milli\tesla}. This means the effective area of our dc-SQUID should be between \qtyrange{0.6}{0.7}{\square\micro\meter} which corresponds to a diameter between \qtyrange{0.87}{0.94}{\micro\meter}. However, we know from the SEM images (see Figure~\ref{fig:CP1.2H-SEM-images}) that the diameter of our effective area must be between \qtyrange{1.2}{1.6}{\micro\meter} (a periodicity between \qtyrange{1}{1.8}{\milli\tesla}). This means the measured period is almost twice the expected period which seems to indicate that either our effective area or the field was much smaller by a factor two.

The previously mentioned flux lensing\cite{prigozhin3DSimulationSuperconducting2018} does not provide an explanation as it would only cause a higher field to penetrate the SQUID and thus a smaller periodicity. We also trust the scale in the SEM images to be correct. In our view this leaves an incorrect field readout as explanation. During our use of the cryostat in which the magnet is housed we later noticed that one of the two power supplies of the magnet was turned off. The current supplies operate in parallel, as such only half the current could be delivered effectively. If the cryostat does not independently measure how much current is delivered then this would explain the factor 2 difference. As such we believe that this caused the incorrect field (readout). Due to time constraints however we have not been able to definitively test this hypothesis.

Furthermore, the highest sensitivity of the dc-SQUID (in the linear regime) is \qtyrange{18}{21}{\micro\volt\per\milli\tesla} (or \qtyrange{36}{42}{\micro\volt\per\milli\tesla} if the field readout was indeed off by a factor two). This is not very good compared to dc-SQUIDs produced in our group earlier. Par example \citeauthor{rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022} \citeyear{rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022} reported a dc-SQUID with similar geometries\footnote{The junctions were however were SNS junctions and not constriction junctions.} with a sensitivity around \qty{105}{\micro\volt\per\milli\tesla}\cite{rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022}. Improving the sensitivity for our current device further would be difficult because we are already near the critical current where we go through the bulk transition. Changing the temperature would be an option, however since taking a SQUID interference pattern takes a long time it was not viable due to the limited measurement time. Measurements at a constant bias current were attempted but did not work for unknown reasons.

Finally, we attempted to measure the CPR at \qty{7.6}{\kelvin}\footnote{Due to the poor dc-SQUID performance we did not expect this to be extremely fruitful. However it is a quick measurement and would not hurt.}. To do so we biased the dc-SQUID at \qty{200}{\micro\ampere}. We then did a current sweep through the junction loop from \qtyrange{-250}{250}{\micro\ampere} and simultaneously measured the voltage over the dc-SQUID. The IV-curve we measured looked suspiciously much like the IV-curve of the dc-SQUID at \qty{7.6}{\kelvin}. This does not make sense and the measurement probably failed for the following two reasons. Firstly, the bias current through the dc-SQUID was too high, pushing it into its normal regime. This can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-critical-current-temperature-dependence}. Secondly, there most likely was a short between some of the connections. The first issue could have been fixed easily, but was only noted too late. The second issue was not investigated further due to time constraints. Even if we had done so we likely would not have been able to fix it in a timely manner.
