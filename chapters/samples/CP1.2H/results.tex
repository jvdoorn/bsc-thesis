	\caption{DC voltage measured by a shorted Keithley 2182A Nanovoltmeter. The RMS noise is \qty{15.90}{\nano\volt}, which is just above the \qty{15}{\nano\volt} as stated in the datasheet\cite{keithleyKeithley2182ANanovoltmeter}. The sampling rate was \qty{0.55\pm0.01}{\hertz}. The Fourier transform used to determine the PSD assumes a constant sampling rate.}
