During the cool down of the Teslatron cryostat in which we measured the sample, we used a 4-point measurement to determine the resistance of the dc-SQUID. See Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-RT}. We note that the sample becomes superconducting at \qty{8}{\kelvin} and has a quite sharp transition. This is above the expected transition temperature of \qty{7.5}{\kelvin} which was measured before on a thin film made from the same sputtering target. This might be explained however by the fact that the \ce{Nb} target had not been used in a while\footnote{It had last been used more than a year ago when the thin film was made.}. As such it is likely that when we sputtered the thin film that it had much more contaminations. $T_c$ for pure \ce{Nb} is \qty{9.2}{\kelvin}\cite{maxfieldSuperconductingPenetrationDepth1965}, since we use sputtering it is not surprising to find a lower $T_c$.

Additionally we determined the temperature dependence of the critical current, see Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-critical-current-temperature-dependence}. We note that, similar to what we see in Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-RT}, that there are two transitions. The obvious one is a very sharp transition but there is a second much more subtle transition. For example at \qty{7.6}{\kelvin} (inset of Figure \ref{fig:CP1.1H-SQUID-critical-current-temperature-dependence}) we note the sharp transition around \qty{170}{\micro\ampere} and the subtle transition near \qty{50}{\micro\ampere}. The sharp transition is for the bulk of the superconductor (leads, contact pads, etc.) whilst the more subtle one is from the dc-SQUID's junctions. This defines the range in which we should measure our dc-SQUID when using it as a magnetometer at certain temperatures.
