In this chapter we present our results on a per sample basis. The results of the first sample, CP1.2H, are not directly useful towards our goal. However, it has thought us a great deal about working with the setup and proved relevant in choosing the geometries for the second sample, CP2.6B. The second sample produced the first real results and shows the feasibility of the method. In our final sample, CP3.5, we made further improvements based on the results of the second sample.
