\chapter{Samples}
In this chapter our results are presented on a per sample basis. The results of the first sample, CP1, are not directly useful towards our goal. However, it has thought us a great deal about working with the setup and proved relevant in choosing the geometries for the second sample, CP2. The second sample produced the first real results and shows the feasibility of the method. In our final sample, CP3, further improvements were made based on the results of the second sample. This sample was destroyed before any useful measurements were taken. It has been included because of its potential for future research. After this sample CP2 was revisited and produced the bulk of our important results.
