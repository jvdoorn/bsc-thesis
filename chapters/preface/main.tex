For this thesis we made extensive use of \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity} by \Citeauthor{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}. Sadly this book makes use of Gaussian units. Where necessary all formulas have been converted to SI units with the help of Table A.1 in \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}. In this thesis we take $e = |e|$ meaning the electron has a charge of $-e$. The charge of a Cooper pair (denoted $e^*$ in \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}) is then $-2e$. The mass of a Cooper pair (denoted $m^*$ in \citetitle{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity}) is two times the mass of a single electron, denoted by $2m_e$ in this thesis.
