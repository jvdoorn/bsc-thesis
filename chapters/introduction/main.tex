\chapter{Introduction}
Josephson junctions have a wide variety of applications. Notable practical applications are qubits\cite{placeNewMaterialPlatform2021,pechenezhskiySuperconductingQuasichargeQubit2020} and microscopic imaging techniques\cite{clarkeSQUIDHandbook2004,rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022}. The behaviour of a Josephson junctions is governed by their current-phase relation (CPR). Probing the CPR can lead to new insights and applications. By measuring the CPR it is possible to if the junction's behaviour is ballistic or diffusive\cite{endresCurrentPhaseRelation2023,kayyalhaHighlySkewedCurrent2020}. Additionally, it has proven the existence of $0$-$\pi$ and $\varphi_0$ junctions\cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004,muraniBallisticEdgeStates2017} as well as non-$2\pi$ periodic CPRs\cite{endresCurrentPhaseRelation2023}.

In our group there is an interest in the CPR of rings of \ce{Sr2RuO4}. Recent work by Lahabi et al. provides evidence for the existence of chiral domain walls in homogenous rings of \ce{Sr2RuO4}\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018} that act as Josephson junctions. As such \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings show dc-SQUID like behaviour without the presence of constrictions, grain boundaries or an interface with a different material. More definitive proof for chiral domain walls could be found by measuring the Josephson energy\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018,sigristRoleDomainWalls1999}. The most elegant way to determine the Josephson energy is to measure the CPR.

This thesis utilizes a method based on the work of Frolov et al. \cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004,frolovCurrentphaseRelationsJosephson2005}. We explore a method to measure the current-phase relation of a single Josephson junction which, if successful, can be extended in later studies to measure the current-phase relation of \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings.

The next chapter will lay a theoretical foundation for our method. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:method} we delve deeper into our method and present numerical calculations to guide our expectations. After this we present our results on a per sample. Finally we draw a conclusion and sketch an outlook.
