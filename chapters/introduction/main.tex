\chapter{Introduction}
Josephson junctions have a wide variety of applications such as qubits\cite{placeNewMaterialPlatform2021,pechenezhskiySuperconductingQuasichargeQubit2020}; superconducting electronics through Josephson diodes\cite{zhangReconfigurableMagneticfieldfreeSuperconducting2023a,ciacciaGateTunableJosephson2023}; and microscopic imaging techniques\cite{clarkeSQUIDHandbook2004,rogSQUIDontipMagneticMicroscopy2022,pranceSensitivityDCSQUID2023}. The behaviour of a Josephson junction is governed by its current-phase relation (CPR). Probing the CPR can lead to new insights and applications. Par example by measuring the CPR it is possible to if the junction's behaviour is ballistic or diffusive\cite{endresCurrentPhaseRelation2023,kayyalhaHighlySkewedCurrent2020}; it has shown the existence of $0$-$\pi$ and $\varphi_0$ junctions\cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004,muraniBallisticEdgeStates2017,strambiniJosephsonPhaseBattery2020,szombatiJosephsonPh0junctionNanowire2016}; as well as non-$2\pi$ periodic CPRs\cite{endresCurrentPhaseRelation2023}.

In our group there is an additional interest in the CPR of homogenous \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings. Recent work by Lahabi \textit{et al.} provides evidence for the existence of chiral domain walls in these rings that act as Josephson junctions.\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018} As such, homogenous \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings show dc-SQUID like behaviour without the presence of constrictions, grain boundaries or an interface with a different material. More definitive proof for chiral domain walls could be found by measuring the Josephson energy.\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018,sigristRoleDomainWalls1999} The most elegant way to determine the Josephson energy is to measure the CPR.

This thesis utilises a method based on the work of Frolov \textit{et al.}. The reader is referred to~\cite{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004,frolovCurrentphaseRelationsJosephson2005} for their work. We explore a method to measure the current-phase relation of a single Josephson junction which, if successful, can be extended in later studies to measure the current-phase relation of \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings.

The next chapter will lay a theoretical foundation for our method. Chapter~\ref{chapter:method} delves deeper into the method and presents numerical calculations to guide our expectations. Then our results are presented on a per sample. Finally a conclusion is drawn and we sketch an outlook for future research.
