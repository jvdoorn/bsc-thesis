\chapter{Introduction}
Recent work by Lahabi \textit{et al.} provides evidence for the existence of chiral domain walls in rings of \ce{Sr2RuO4}\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018} that act as Josephson junctions. Due to this effect, homogenous \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings show dc-SQUID like behaviour without the presence of constrictions, grain boundaries or an interface with a different material. More definitive proof for chiral domain walls could be found by measuring the Josephson energy\cite{lahabiSpintripletSupercurrentsOdd2018}. A prerequisite to determining the Josephson energy is measuring the current-phase relation\footnote{The phase here refers to the phase order parameter in Ginzburg-Landau theory.}.

This thesis presents a method based on \citeauthor{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004} \citeyear{frolovMeasurementCurrentPhaseRelation2004}. We explore a method to measure the current-phase relation of a single Josephson junction which, if successful, can be extended in later studies to measure the current-phase relation of \ce{Sr2RuO4} rings.
